# TSStreamer

TSStreamer is a demonstrator for a Online Time Series Display that
operates with ADU-07e, ADU-08e and ADU-10e.

It can be compiled for Desktop (Windows/Linux) and Android.

It catches time series data from ADU system via HTTPS requests and hence
should work in almost all networks where HTTPS is not blocked by firewall.
